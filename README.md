PWA will support the following features in the future like:
Bluetooth — Web Bluetooth API is under development and we will soon access Bluetooth on the web platform.
Sensors — Sensors are a really important part of today’s development era.Some sensor’s access is already in development like ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, accelerometer sensor, magnetometer sensor, and a gyroscope sensor.
Native Sharing — We can invoke the native sharing mechanism of the device as part of the Web Share API.
Fingerprint Sensor — We can authenticate users via the fingerprint sensor using Web Authentication API. But is it still under development due to security reasons.
